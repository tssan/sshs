# SSH Select

This is simple tool to keep all hosts used for ssh connection in one place and have quick access to them.

## Requirements

* Python3.5+
* pip3


## Install (at own risk ;p)

1. clone this repo

2. run `make install` (user must have permissions to install packages)


## Uninstall

This is tricky ;p

`make uninstall` (also requires permissions)

After that binary file is still in `/usr/local/bin/`  (debian) so you may want to remove it manually
